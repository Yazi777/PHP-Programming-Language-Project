#PHP

#Question 1
My language of choice is called PHP. It originally stood for _Personal Home Page_ but is now 
a "recursive backronym" as _PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor_.

#Question 2
The development of PHP started in 1994 with a man named Rasmus Lerdorf, and was released on June 8th of 1995. 
It was developed organically - meaning the original creator did not originally intend to develop a new 
programming language - and started as Lerdorf's writing CGI (Common Gateway Interface) programs in 
the language C, then continuing to extend their functions. Development teams thenn went on to improve 
and rewrite parts of PHP, thus helping form it into a programming language. Said Lerdorf on its creation, 
"I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programmming language. . .I have absolutely 
no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way." 

#Question 3
PHP is a general-purpose, server-side scripting language, widely used for web development and often partnered with HTML. 

#Question 4
For the most part, PHP is an interpreted language, but some sources say it "uses a blend of interpretation and compilation". 
It is also possible to write a compiler for PHP.

#Question 5
PHP is especially suited for use with websites. The three main areas where PHP scripts are used are server-side scripting, 
command line scripting, and writing desktop applications.

#Question 6
The three most popular projects on GitHub involving PHP are robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh - "A delightful community-driven framework 
for managing your zsh configuration", blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - "File upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop 
support, progress bar, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery", and laravel/laravel - "A PHP Framework For 
Web Artisans".

#Question 7
I will most likely get most of my information on PHP from W3Schools, codecademy, and php.net.

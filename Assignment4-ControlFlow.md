###Conditional Statements

PHP allows if, if/else, and if/elseif/else statements. It does not have other statements similar, however - e.g. Perl's "unless" conditional statement.

###Short-circuit evaluation

PHP does use short-circuit evaluation. An example can be found with the code for this page in the repository. In PHP, these four operators are short-circuit: &&, ||, and, or.  
Note that & and | are not short-circuit.
